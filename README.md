# Layoffs Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of SQL to clean, transform, and analyze a layoffs dataset. It covers key data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, standardizing values, handling missing data, and deleting irrelevant records. It also includes exploratory data analysis to identify trends, summarize layoffs by company, industry, country, and time.

## Features

* Data cleaning with removal of duplicates and null handling
* Standardization of text fields (e.g., company names, industry, country)
* Date formatting and conversion for time series analysis
* Deletion of irrelevant or incomplete records to improve data quality
* Aggregation and grouping to summarize layoffs by different dimensions
* Use of window functions (ROW_NUMBER) to identify duplicates
* Rolling totals and time-based grouping for trend analysis

## Technologies Used

* MySQL (or your SQL dialect)
* SQL Window Functions
* Data aggregation and joins

## How to Use

* Run the SQL scripts sequentially to clean the dataset
* Use the provided queries for exploratory data analysis and reporting
* Modify filtering/grouping fields to explore different trends
